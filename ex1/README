The program do not chech if the input number is correct (3 digit and the first and last digit are different.
For checking that the following lines should be added:

while int(input_number/100)==int(input_number%10) or input_number>1000: # check if the number is correct
    input_number = int(input("Please choose another 3 digit number:"))
