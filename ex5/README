NonRecursiveMystery: Implement a recursive function for sum of divisors in iterative way 
                     (divisors=without remainder).
GetToTheZero: Check if James Bond can pass the corridor undetected.
AlignDNA: Task 1: Calculate the match between 2 DNA strands with 3 optinal score for match, missmatch and gap.
          Task 2: Find the match between two unaligned DNA  strands that give the best score
                  as calculate in task 1
