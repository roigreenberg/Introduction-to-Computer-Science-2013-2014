=  Description:  =
==================

in oneliners.py I implement several tasks:

is_two_palindrome: The function tests if the given string is a “two palindrome” or not.
                   A string is a palindrome if reversing it does not change it.

uni_sort:          The function combines two unsorted lists of integers into one sorted list.

dot_product:       The function returns the dot product of two vectors, represented as lists.

list_intersection: The function combines two unsorted lists of integers into one sorted.
                   list contain exactly those integers that appear in both input lists.

list_difference:   The function combines two unsorted lists of integers into one sorted
                   list contain only those integers that appear in just one of the input lists.

random_string:     The function generates a random string of a given length using only lower-case characters
	I have used the imports randint (from module random) and string
	1)randint - I used randint in order to create a random letter by giving chr() a random number in the
	 	    range of numbers that represent lower-case letters.
	2)string - i used "join" from the string module in order to convert the list of the random letters
	 	   into a string as requsted

word_mapper:       The function returns a dictionary mapping from the words in the
                   input text to their number appearances
	I have used the import re
	By using re.sub() I could convert every nonletter in the string(converted to lower-case letters)
        into a whitespaces then I could use .split in order to create a list containing only the words
	from the string.

gimme_a_value:     The function create a generator that gets two inputs, a function(f) and a starting point (x0).
                   The generator computes a sequence of values (x1,x2...) of the function.
                   For all i>=0 The i-th call to the generator returns the value x(i)=f(x(i-1)
                   The first call returns x0 (the initial value)
